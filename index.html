          <p>Hi, my name is Barbara. I am an aspiring fullstack developer and will soon be completing the full stack bootcamp at Thinkful.</p>
          <p>Instead of shaping young minds like I did in my 4 years as a pre-k teacher, I've moved on to shaping code and design sketches into responsive apps and webpages. My favorite part about coding is watching the ideas I have or a simple drawing  come to life on the screen.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding, I can often be found out and about playing Pokemon Go, telling my cat how beautiful she is, or playing a variety of other games with my friends. I am always trying to improve, learn, and grow, and find a lot of personal fulfillment in challenging myself and picking up new skills.</p>
          <p>The best way to contact me is through email at barbaraloismoore@gmail.com or via LinkedIn (above).
