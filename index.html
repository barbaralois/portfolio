          <p>Hi, my name is Barbara. I am an aspiring fullstack developer and will soon be completing the full stack bootcamp at Thinkful.</p>
          <p>Instead of shaping young minds like I did in my 4 years as a pre-k teacher, I've moved on to shaping code and design sketches into responsive apps and webpages. My favorite part about coding is watching the ideas I have or a simple drawing come to life on the screen. When I'm not coding, I can often be found out and about playing Pokemon Go, telling my cat how beautiful she is, or playing a variety of other games with my friends. </p>
          <p>I am always trying to improve, learn, and grow, and find a lot of personal fulfillment in challenging myself and picking up new skills. I also credit my mentor and collaborative work during Thinkful's bootcamp with much of my growth as a developer, so I'm eager to find a team to continue to learn with.</p>
          <p>Want to get in touch? I am best reached via email at <a href="mailto:barbaraloismoore@gmail.com" class="offsite-link">barbaraloismoore@gmail.com</a> or you can send me a message over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barbara-moore-5787b718b/" target="_blank" class="offsite-link">LinkedIn</a>. I look forward to hearing from you!
